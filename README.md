# Sorting Algorithm Implementation in C and Assembly

This project demonstrates the implementation of basic sorting algorithms—Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, and Insertion Sort—in both C and Assembly language. The program sorts a small array of numbers using each algorithm to highlight differences in approach and performance.

## Project Overview
This project is designed to showcase basic sorting algorithms implemented in both C and Assembly languages. Each algorithm sorts an array of numbers in ascending order, and the project focuses on understanding the implementation differences between high-level and low-level languages.

The project is useful for anyone learning about sorting algorithms and low-level programming, and can serve as a foundation for further optimization or comparison of algorithm efficiency.

## Sorting Algorithms
### Selection Sort
Selection Sort is an in-place, comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly selecting the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array and swapping it with the first unsorted element.

### Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This pass through the list is repeated until the array is sorted.

### Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort works by building a sorted array one element at a time. It removes one element from the input data and finds the appropriate location within the sorted portion of the array.

## Technologies Used
- **C Language**: For the high-level implementation of sorting algorithms.
- **Assembly Language**: For the low-level implementation of sorting algorithms.
- **GCC**: For compiling C code.
- **NASM or MASM**: For assembling the Assembly code.
